## What is this?
The Free Draw Bot is a program that will draw images for you. Simply input a custom data file or an image and the bot will draw it for you.

## How do I install this?
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Free-Draw-Bot/releases/) page and download the latest release. Then open up the file "main.py" and let the program handle the rest

<sub>([Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed)

## Settings
Settings can be configured in the program so you can get an optimal experience

`Start Delay`: A delay that lets you switch from the program to your drawing app

`Drawing Speed`: How fast should the bot draw. The closer the number is to 0 the faster it draws but quality may be affected (Note: In games like [Free Draw 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/1547610457/Free-Draw-2?refPageId=62992532-fb54-4ca4-8f42-0e91db8babf9) setting the draw speed to fast can make it not register the mouse)

`X offset`: How far should the image be moved on the X axis

`Y offset`: How far should the image be moved on the X axis

`Progress Bar Style`: The style of the progress bar
